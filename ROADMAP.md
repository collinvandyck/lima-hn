| 22 | Share Integration        | Platform-specific (macOS share sheet, etc.). Limited audience.                  |
| 23 | Screen Reader Support    | Accessibility: focus announcements, terminal reader compat.                     |
| 24 | High Contrast Mode       | Accessibility: dedicated theme, disable colors option.                          |
| 25 | Plugin System            | Lua/WASM extensibility. Very ambitious, likely overkill.                        |
| 26 | Focus Mode               | Hide scores/counts. Niche but interesting for mindful reading.                  |
| 27 | Multi-Account            | Switch HN accounts. Very niche use case.                                        |
| 28 | Comment Threading Viz    | ASCII tree view like `git log --graph`. Fun but niche.                          |
| 29 | HN "Wrapped"             | Reading stats. Fun year-end feature, requires history first.                    |
| 30 | Gemini/Gopher Support    | Text-protocol fetching. Very niche.                                             |

## Navigation & Discovery

### Pagination / Infinite Scroll ✓
Implemented with automatic infinite scroll. Stories load in the background as you navigate near the bottom of the list. The UI remains responsive during fetches with a spinner indicator in the tab bar.

### Search
HN has Algolia-powered search. Could integrate:
- Full-text search across stories and comments
- Filter by date range, points threshold, author
- Search within current comment thread (local, no API)

### User Profiles
View any user's profile by pressing a key on their username:
- Karma, about text, account age
- Recent submissions and comments
- Could cache profiles like we cache items

### Story Filtering
Local filters to customize what you see:
- Hide stories below N points
- Hide stories with certain domains
- Keyword blocklist
- Show only self-posts or link posts

---

## Reading Experience

### Read/Unread Tracking
Persist which stories you've opened:
- Dim or mark read stories
- "Jump to next unread" keybinding
- Clear read history command
- Store in local SQLite or JSON file

### Comment Enhancements
- Highlight OP's comments distinctly
- Show comment score (currently hidden in API but available)
- Jump between top-level comments (skip replies)
- Expand/collapse all at once
- "New" badge for comments posted since you last viewed the thread

### Code Block Formatting
Comments often contain code. Could:
- Detect code blocks (indentation or backticks in text)
- Apply monospace styling
- Optional: syntax highlighting via `syntect`

### Link Preview
When cursor is on a story, show preview of the URL:
- Domain, page title, description (via HEAD request or meta scraping)
- Could be a toggleable panel or popup
- Respect user privacy—make it opt-in

---

## Bookmarks & History

### Local Bookmarks
Save stories for later without needing an HN account:
- Press `b` to bookmark current story
- Dedicated "Bookmarks" feed in the tab bar
- Persist to `~/.config/lima-hn/bookmarks.json`
- Export bookmarks to markdown

### View History
Track what you've read:
- "Recently Viewed" feed
- Timestamp of last view
- Could combine with read/unread tracking

---

## HN Account Integration

### Login Support
HN doesn't have OAuth, but cookie-based auth could work:
- Login via username/password (stored securely in keyring)
- Or paste session cookie manually

### Upvoting
Once logged in:
- Upvote stories and comments
- Visual indicator of what you've upvoted
- Undo upvote

### Commenting & Replies
- Reply to comments inline
- Compose in `$EDITOR` for longer replies
- Preview before posting
- Submit new stories

Note: These require careful implementation—HN has rate limits and anti-abuse measures.

---

## Performance & Offline

### Background Refresh
Keep feeds fresh without manual refresh:
- Periodic background fetch (configurable interval)
- Only refresh visible/active feed
- Show indicator when new stories available

### Offline Mode
Save content for reading without internet:
- Cache stories and comments to disk
- "Save for offline" command
- Graceful degradation when network unavailable
- Sync when back online

### Preloading
Speculatively load content:
- Prefetch comments for stories near cursor
- Prefetch next page of stories
- Balance between responsiveness and bandwidth

---

## UI Polish

### Mouse Support
Crossterm already captures mouse events. Could add:
- Click to select story/comment
- Click tabs to switch feeds
- Scroll wheel navigation
- Click links to open

### Split View
View stories and comments side-by-side:
- Configurable layout (horizontal/vertical split)
- Stories list on left, comments on right
- Update comments as you navigate stories

### Customizable Keybindings
Let users remap keys:
- Config file in `~/.config/lima-hn/keys.toml`
- Support for common schemes (vim, emacs, arrow-only)
- Show current bindings in help overlay

### Status Bar Improvements
- Show time since last refresh
- Network indicator (online/offline)
- Story position in feed (e.g., "15/500")
- Unread count badge

---

## Export & Sharing

### Export Thread
Save a comment thread for reference:
- Export to markdown, plain text, or JSON
- Include metadata (title, URL, author, time)
- Optionally include only expanded comments

### Copy to Clipboard
Quick copy operations:
- Copy story URL
- Copy HN discussion URL
- Copy selected comment text
- Copy story as markdown link

### Share Integration
Platform-specific sharing:
- macOS: Share sheet
- Linux: xdg-open with share URLs
- Generate shareable short links

---

## Developer Experience

### Debug Mode ✓
Implemented with backtick (`) toggle. Shows:
- Running async tasks with elapsed time
- Event log of completed operations
Future enhancements could add cache stats, API timing details, and log-to-file.

### Plugin System
Allow extending functionality:
- Lua or WASM plugins
- Hooks for events (story selected, comment loaded, etc.)
- Custom commands
- Theme hot-reloading

This is ambitious and probably overkill, but could be interesting.

---

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader Support
Improve accessibility:
- Proper focus announcements
- Alt text for visual elements
- Compatible with terminal screen readers

### High Contrast Mode
For users who need it:
- Dedicated high-contrast theme
- Option to disable colors entirely
- Minimum contrast ratio enforcement

---

## Wild Ideas

### Multi-Account
Switch between HN accounts (if you have multiple).

### Hacker News "Wrapped"
Year-end stats about your reading habits—most read topics, favorite authors, peak browsing times.

### Comment Threading Visualization
ASCII art tree view of comment structure, like `git log --graph`.

### "Focus Mode"
Hide scores and comment counts to reduce engagement-driven reading. Just titles and content.

### Gemini/Gopher Support
Fetch and display stories from text-only protocols for linked content.
