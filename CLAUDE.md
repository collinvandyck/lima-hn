# lima-hn

A terminal UI for Hacker News built with Rust and Ratatui.

## Development Setup

This project uses `mise` to manage tools. Run `mise install` to set up:
- `rust` (stable for building, nightly for formatting)
- `just` (command runner)
- `gh` (GitHub CLI)
- `lazygit` (git TUI)

## Quick Reference

```bash
just              # Run TUI in dev mode
just test         # Run tests
just fmt          # Format with nightly rustfmt
just snap         # Update snapshots
just ci           # Full CI check (fmt, lint, test)
just themes       # List available themes
```

## Workflow

After making changes:
1. `just fmt` - Format code (uses nightly rustfmt)
2. `just test` - Run unit tests
3. `just lint` - Check for warnings

## Architecture

**Elm Architecture pattern:**
- `App` struct holds all state (`src/app.rs`)
- `Message` enum defines all state transitions
- `update()` processes messages, `render()` draws UI
- Views are pure functions: `render(frame, app, area)`

**Key modules:**
- `api/` - HN API client with caching, types (Story, Comment, Feed)
- `app.rs` - Application state, message handling, navigation
- `views/` - UI rendering (stories, comments, spinner)
- `theme/` - 12 built-in themes, TOML custom themes, terminal dark/light detection
- `cli.rs` - Clap-based CLI with theme subcommands
- `keys.rs` - Vim-style keybindings
- `test_utils.rs` - Test data builders for view testing

## Features

- Vim keybindings (j/k, g/G, H/L, etc.)
- 6 feeds: Top, New, Best, Ask, Show, Jobs
- Collapsible comment trees with depth coloring
- 12 built-in themes + custom TOML themes
- Auto dark/light detection
- Loading spinner animation

## Testing

View tests use `ratatui::TestBackend` + `insta` snapshots:

```rust
let app = TestAppBuilder::new()
    .with_stories(sample_stories())
    .selected(0)
    .build();

let output = render_to_string(80, 24, |frame| {
    views::stories::render(frame, &app, frame.area());
});

insta::assert_snapshot!(output);
```

Snapshots live in `src/views/snapshots/` and are version controlled.

**Test data builders:** `StoryBuilder`, `CommentBuilder`, `TestAppBuilder` in `test_utils.rs`

## CLI

```bash
lima-hn                        # Run TUI
lima-hn --theme monokai        # Use specific theme
lima-hn --dark / --light       # Force variant
lima-hn theme list             # List themes
lima-hn theme show <name>      # Print theme TOML
lima-hn theme path             # Custom themes directory
```

## Theme System

Themes define semantic colors (story_title, story_score, comment_depth_colors, etc.). See `src/theme/builtin.rs` for examples. Custom themes go in `~/.config/lima-hn/themes/*.toml`.

## Code Style

**Modular code:** Keep functions focused and composable. Prefer small, single-purpose modules over large files.

**Tests:** High signal-to-noise ratio. Use builders and helpers (`TestAppBuilder`, `sample_stories()`) to hide setup boilerplate. Test names should describe the behavior being verified. The test body should make the "what" immediately clear.

**Comments:** Only where they add real value. No comments that merely restate what the code does. Good comments explain *why* something non-obvious exists, document tricky edge cases, or clarify intent that isn't obvious from the code itself. If code needs a comment to be understood, first consider if the code can be made clearer.

**Markdown formatting:** Use bold sparingly—only for key terms on first use or critical warnings, not for emphasis in running text. Avoid emojis entirely. Let the content speak for itself.

**Markdown tables:** Format tables for terminal readability. Align columns by padding cells to consistent widths. Headers and separators should match the column width. Example:

```markdown
| #  | Feature    | Rationale                                 |
|----|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Pagination | API supports it, UI doesn't expose it.    |
| 2  | Bookmarks  | Completes core reading workflow.          |
```
